#  Tips money app

## Challenge

With this app in hand, youâ€™ll never need to do maths ever again when you have to make a bill splitting.  I ve designed this application for iPhone 11 layout and implemented the buttons and labels using the Main.storyboard, and the rest of the graphic part (background & icons) using the Sketch application.

You'll see the UI stepper in action and implementation of it, the User Interface programmated without the use of
Storyboards, as well as a multi-screen app by segues.
I used also some features from Optionals, including Optional Binding, Optional Chaining, and the Nil Coalescing Operator.
